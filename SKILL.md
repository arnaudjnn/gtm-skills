# GTM Skills

## Overview

Outbound email workflows, buying signal detection, and LinkedIn social intelligence, powered by Bash. Covers the full cold outreach lifecycle (sending campaigns, classifying replies, following up, cleaning bounces, reporting analytics), buying signal detection across Trustpilot reviews, social media growth, and LinkedIn hiring activity, plus LinkedIn tools for profiles, posts, jobs, company research, and messaging.

All tools are called in the Bash tool. Just set the endpoint URL and API key as environment variables.

## Quick Routing

**First time using GTM skills?** → `setup`

**Anything related to cold email?** → `outbound`

**Looking for buying signals on a domain?** → `signals`

**LinkedIn research, posts, or messaging?** → `socials`

## Common Setup

Run the **setup** sub-skill to get started. It walks you through selecting skill groups (Outbound, Signals, Socials, or All), deploying the required servers, configuring API keys as environment variables, and verifying everything works.

Just ask: "Set up GTM skills." or run `/setup`.
